But in at least 11 cases in the past three and a half years, Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system did just that. This led to 11 accidents in which Teslas crashed into emergency vehicles or other vehicles at those scenes, resulting in 17 injuries and one death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has launched an investigation into Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot system in response to the crashes. The incidents took place between January 2018 and July 2021 in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas. The probe covers 765,000 Tesla cars \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s virtually every car the company has made in the last seven years. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s also not the first time the federal government has investigated Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a researcher who studies autonomous vehicles, I believe the investigation will put pressure on Tesla to reevaluate the technologies the company uses in Autopilot and could influence the future of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot works\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot uses cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to support two major features: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control, also known as adaptive cruise control, maintains a safe distance between the car and other vehicles that are driving ahead of it. This technology primarily uses cameras in conjunction with artificial intelligence algorithms to detect surrounding objects such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, and estimate their distances. Autosteer uses cameras to detect clearly marked lines on the road to keep the vehicle within its lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its Autopilot capabilities, Tesla has been offering what it calls \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153full self-driving\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d features that include autopark and auto lane change. Since its first offering of the Autopilot system and other self-driving features, Tesla has consistently warned users that these technologies require active driver supervision and that these features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla is beefing up the AI technology that underpins Autopilot. The company announced on Aug. 19, 2021, that it is building a supercomputer using custom chips. The supercomputer will help train Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s AI system to recognize objects seen in video feeds collected by cameras in the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopilot does not equal autonomous\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvanced driver-assistance systems have been supported on a wide range of vehicles for many decades. The Society of Automobile Engineers divides the degree of a vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s automation into six levels, starting from Level 0, with no automated driving features, to Level 5, which represents full autonomous driving with no need for human intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin these six levels of autonomy, there is a clear and vivid divide between Level 2 and Level 3. In principle, at Levels 0, 1 and 2, the vehicle should be primarily controlled by a human driver, with some assistance from driver-assistance systems. At Levels 3, 4 and 5, the vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s AI components and related driver-assistance technologies are the primary controller of the vehicle. For example, Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s self-driving taxis, which operate in the Phoenix area, are Level 4, which means they operate without human drivers but only under certain weather and traffic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla Autopilot is considered a Level 2 system, and hence the primary controller of the vehicle should be a human driver. This provides a partial explanation for the incidents cited by the federal investigation. Though Tesla says it expects drivers to be alert at all times when using the Autopilot features, some drivers treat the Autopilot as having autonomous driving capability with little or no need for human monitoring or intervention. This discrepancy between Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s instructions and driver behavior seems to be a factor in the incidents under investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother possible factor is how Tesla assures that drivers are paying attention. Earlier versions of Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot were ineffective in monitoring driver attention and engagement level when the system is on. The company instead relied on requiring drivers to periodically move the steering wheel, which can be done without watching the road. Tesla recently announced that it has begun using internal cameras to monitor drivers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 attention and alert drivers when they are inattentive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother equally important factor contributing to Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s vehicle crashes is the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s choice of sensor technologies. Tesla has consistently avoided the use of lidar. In simple terms, lidar is like radar but with lasers instead of radio waves. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s capable of precisely detecting objects and estimating their distances. Virtually all major companies working on autonomous vehicles, including Waymo, Cruise, Volvo, Mercedes, Ford and GM, are using lidar as an essential technology for enabling automated vehicles to perceive their environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy relying on cameras, Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot is prone to potential failures caused by challenging lighting conditions, such as glare and darkness. In its announcement of the Tesla investigation, the NHTSA reported that most incidents occurred after dark where there were flashing emergency vehicle lights, flares or other lights. Lidar, in contrast, can operate under any lighting conditions and can \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153see\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d in the dark.\\r\\n\", \"Category\": \"Tesla\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"001.txt-Tesla\"}, {\"File_Name\": \"002.txt\", \"Content\": \"Tesla Wants To Launch Full Self-Driving Public Beta In September\\r\\nAfter a few days ago Elon Musk announced that the public debut of Full Self-Driving Beta was just weeks away, now the Tesla CEO has tweeted the exact time and date when Version 10 Beta will be made available to beta testers. Musk has now officially set the date for next Friday and he expects that about two weeks after that (around September 25), an updated version, Beta 10.1 is expected to be good enough for public rollout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo after being postponed several times and many months, it looks like all Tesla owners whose vehicles have the right hardware will be able to experience FSD.

(Videos)\\r\\nIn theory, we are getting closer and closer to a wide release of Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s beta feature-complete \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Full Self Driving\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d package. If you\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re familiar with all of the background on this, skip to the third paragraph. If not, here\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s the short story: Tesla has been working for years to increase its vehicles\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 autonomous driving features. From not running over cats & dogs, to being able to change lanes on an Interstate highway without playing bumper cars, to being able to navigate through parking lots solo, Tesla cars have been getting more and more capable of autonomous driving. Two years ago, CEO Elon Musk indicated that Tesla vehicles with the \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Full Self Driving\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d (FSD) package would have \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153feature complete\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d autonomous driving abilities by the end of the year (the end of 2019). They wouldn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t yet be ready to roam the streets as robotaxis, but they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122d be able to drive from door to door on their own \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d with human supervision. It turns out, though, that Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s method at the time had some software ceilings that just weren\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t going to make that practical.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla implemented a thorough rewrite/restart on its software approach to autonomous driving that took several months (or about a year). And then more hurdles popped up. In order to get to the level Tesla needed for wide release of the feature-complete FSD package, as Elon recently put it, it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s been a matter of two steps forward, one step back \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d over and over again. The running joke among many Tesla fans is that wide release of the door-to-door FSD features has been ~2 weeks away for a year, or nearly two years. At the moment, based on the last update, it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s ~3 weeks away. In the meantime, there are a few thousand special Tesla owners who have had the capabilities in their cars for the past several months and have been sending feedback to Tesla to help it refine the system. With each update, some of them have been posting videos on YouTube and Twitter. That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s where we can bring the others back in.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of weeks ago, Tesla rolled out the v9.2 update of its FSD Beta system. Curious about how the self-driving tech is coming along, inspired by AI Day, and eager to potentially get the door-to-door FSD features in my Tesla Model 3 in a few weeks, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ve been watching some of the recent videos. Below are a few good ones and some notes underneath them for anyone who is morally opposed to clicking play on 15 minute YouTube videos or even a sped-up 2:19 Twitter video.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this first one, Chuck Cook starts off by tackling one of the biggest challenges he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s seen FSD struggle with. He tries to get his Model 3 to take a left turn across three lanes of traffic, through an opening between the median, and into the traffic flowing left. The car doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t feel comfortable trying this on two attempts and decides to turn right instead. I can understand deciding to skip that turn \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d I would typically avoid making a turn like that \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d but the thing I found odd was that after making the right turn, instead of getting over in the left lane to try to turn around on the desired route, it reroutes into a loop that would just put the car right back to the place where it failed to make the unprotected left turn. Odd.\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck then goes and finds a similar spot. He says the visibility is a bit better at this spot. He gets the car to make the left turn after much hesitation, but he has to tap the accelerator a couple of times to give it the encouragement to go. He goes back to the spot again and it makes the turn without any nudging when it sees a nice opening. He also indicates in the video that he likes how quickly the car accelerates once it makes the turn, but he wonders what the car would do if there was traffic on the other side of the median but not before the median \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d if the car would cross over and wait in the median area until there was an opening on the other side, or if it would just decide the turn was too challenging and avoid crossing altogether. On the third attempt in the same spot, the car again has an opening in both direction and makes the turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext up, Chuck decides to see if the car will nicely leave this partially divided highway and turn left across three lanes of traffic safely. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s drizzling a bit and the car starts driving quickly into the turn. It doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t cross any lines, but it is driving quite fast and there\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fast oncoming traffic. Chuck doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t like what he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s seeing and he decides to intervene to make sure the car doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t drive into traffic. (I would have done the same.) Even if Chuck hadn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t intervened and the car had stopped itself before causing an accident, it seems that it would have stopped too suddenly for the driver\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s/passenger\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s comfort. He goes back to make the attempt again and the car waits for traffic and makes the turn pretty much perfectly. In a third attempt, the car goes back to the tendency it had in the first scenario and seems intent on zipping across the lanes when it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not safe to do so, then it apparently sees the oncoming vehicles and makes a sudden stop before crossing any lane markings. Though, the activity freaked out an oncoming pickup driver enough that the truck quickly started swerving into the lane to its right. Then he sees the Tesla stop and swings back. Did the pickup truck driver check carefully before starting to move into the lane next to it? I hope so, but the whole segment comes across as a bit sketchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chuck returns to the unprotected left turn attempts. Visibility is bad on the left, but a big gap eventually appears and the car cautiously starts to make the turn. Lines on the touchscreen indicate it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s going to turn left, but then the car gets a bit spooked (presumably about cars coming from the right) and decides to bail on the navigation\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s plan and turn right instead. Whoops. Chuck believes that the system thinks it needs to have clear traffic in both directions to make these turns, even though it could stop in the middle. Perhaps it just sees that middle space as inadequate, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not clear exactly why it won\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t go sit in that middle spot and wait for the second opening.

NHTSA is currently looking into a handful of crashes in which Teslas, apparently operating with Autopilot engaged, crashed into parked emergency vehicles and caused injuries or other damage. Tesla has until October 22 to hand over the data, which includes details on which of the vehicles it has sold are equipped with Autopilot as well as the system's operating parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a public document that was also sent directly to Tesla, NHTSA asks the company to provide a list of every Tesla outfitted with the company's self-driving tech, including which hardware and software versions the car uses, as well as information on every crash the company is aware of involving a vehicle equipped with Autopilot. NHTSA has also asked for precise details of Autopilot's operating limits, including the maximum steering angle and maximum rates of acceleration and braking. The document also requests details about how the Autopilot system interacts with the driver, including a list of situations that would cause the system to disengage, and details of how and when driver inputs can override the Autopilot functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHTSA investigation is focused on 12 crashes between Teslas and stopped emergency vehicles. When the investigation launched a few weeks ago, only 11 crashes were under investigation. But a collision between a Model 3 and a highway patrol car in Orlando, Florida last Saturday became the 12th crash on NHTSA's list.

But in at least 11 cases in the past three and a half years, Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system did just that. This led to 11 accidents in which Teslas crashed into emergency vehicles or other vehicles at those scenes, resulting in 17 injuries and 1 death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has launched an investigation into Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot system in response to the crashes. The incidents took place between January 2018 and July 2021 in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas. The probe covers 765,000 Tesla cars\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthat\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s virtually every car the company has made in the past seven years. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s also not the first time the federal government has investigated Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot. As a researcher who studies autonomous vehicles, I believe the investigation will put pressure on Tesla to reevaluate the technologies the company uses in Autopilot and could influence the future of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. How Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot works Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot uses cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to support two major features: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control, also known as adaptive cruise control, maintains a safe distance between the car and other vehicles that are driving ahead of it. This technology primarily uses cameras in conjunction with artificial intelligence algorithms to detect surrounding objects, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, and estimate their distances. Autosteer uses cameras to detect clearly marked lines on the road to keep the vehicle within its lane. In addition to its Autopilot capabilities, Tesla has been offering what it calls \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153full self-driving\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d features that include autopark and auto lane change. Since its first offering of the Autopilot system and other self-driving features, Tesla has consistently warned users that these technologies require active driver supervision and that these features do not make the vehicle autonomous. Tesla is beefing up the AI technology that underpins Autopilot. The company announced on August 19, 2021, that it is building a supercomputer using custom chips. The supercomputer will help train Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s AI system to recognize objects seen in video feeds collected by cameras in the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopilot does not equal autonomous Advanced driver-assistance systems have been supported on a wide range of vehicles for many decades. The Society of Automobile Engineers divides the degree of a vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s automation into six levels, starting from Level 0, with no automated driving features; to Level 5, which represents full autonomous driving with no need for human intervention. Within these six levels of autonomy, there is a clear and vivid divide between Level 2 and Level 3. In principle, at Levels 0, 1, and 2, the vehicle should be primarily controlled by a human driver, with some assistance from driver-assistance systems. At Levels 3, 4, and 5, the vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s AI components and related driver-assistance technologies are the primary controller of the vehicle. For example, Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s self-driving taxis, which operate in the Phoenix area, are Level 4, which means they operate without human drivers but only under certain weather and traffic conditions. Tesla Autopilot is considered a Level 2 system, and hence the primary controller of the vehicle should be a human driver. This provides a partial explanation for the incidents cited by the federal investigation. Though Tesla says it expects drivers to be alert at all times when using the Autopilot features, some drivers treat the Autopilot as having autonomous driving capability with little or no need for human monitoring or intervention. This discrepancy between Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s instructions and driver behavior seems to be a factor in the incidents under investigation.\", \"Category\": \"Waymo\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"017.txt-Waymo\"}, {\"File_Name\": \"018.txt\", \"Content\": \"Another possible factor is how Tesla assures that drivers are paying attention. Earlier versions of Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot were ineffective in monitoring driver attention and engagement level when the system is on. The company instead relied on requiring drivers to periodically move the steering wheel, which can be done without watching the road. Tesla recently announced that it has begun using internal cameras to monitor drivers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 attention and alert drivers when they are inattentive. Another equally important factor contributing to Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s vehicle crashes is the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s choice of sensor technologies. Tesla has consistently avoided the use of lidar. In simple terms, lidar is like radar but with lasers instead of radio waves. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s capable of precisely detecting objects and estimating their distances. Virtually all major companies working on autonomous vehicles, including Waymo, Cruise, Volvo, Mercedes, Ford, and GM, are using lidar as an essential technology for enabling automated vehicles to perceive their environments. By relying on cameras, Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot is prone to potential failures caused by challenging lighting conditions, such as glare and darkness. In its announcement of the Tesla investigation, the NHTSA reported that most incidents occurred after dark where there were flashing emergency vehicle lights, flares or other lights. Lidar, in contrast, can operate under any lighting conditions and can \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153see\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFallout from the investigation The preliminary evaluation will determine whether the NHTSA should proceed with an engineering analysis, which could lead to a recall. The investigation could eventually lead to changes in future Tesla Autopilot and its other self-driving system. The investigation might also indirectly have a broader impact on the deployment of future autonomous vehicles; in particular, the investigation may reinforce the need for lidar. Although reports in May 2021 indicated that Tesla was testing lidar sensors, it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not clear whether the company was quietly considering the technology or using it to validate their existing sensor systems. Tesla CEO Elon Musk called lidar \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153a fool\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s errand\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d in 2019, saying it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s expensive and unnecessary. However, just as Tesla is revisiting systems that monitor driver attention, the NHTSA investigation could push the company to consider adding lidar or similar technologies to future vehicles.\\r\\n\", \"Category\": \"Waymo\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"018.txt-Waymo\"}, {\"File_Name\": \"019.txt\", \"Content\": \"Earlier this year, Waymo was trying to produce 5 to 10 vehicles a day at the factory, says one former employee.

       "'Why the feds are investigating Teslaâ€™s Autopilot and what that means for the future of self-driving cars\\r\\nItâ€™s hard to miss the flashing lights of fire engines, ambulances and police cars ahead of you as youâ€™re driving down the road. But in at least 11 cases in the past three and a half years, Teslaâ€™s Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system did just that. This led to 11 accidents in which Teslas crashed into emergency vehicles or other vehicles at those scenes, resulting in 17 injuries and one death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has launched an investigation into Teslaâ€™s Autopilot system in response to the crashes. The incidents took place between January 2018 and July 2021 in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas. The probe covers 765,000 Tesla cars â€“ thatâ€™s virtually every car the company has made in the last seven years. Itâ€™s also not the first time the federal government has investigated Teslaâ€™s Autopilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a researcher who studies autonomous vehicles, I believe the investigation will put pressure on Tesla to reevaluate the technologies the company uses in Autopilot and could influence the future of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Teslaâ€™s Autopilot works\\r\\n\\r\\nTeslaâ€™s Autopilot uses cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to support two major features: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control, also known as adaptive cruise control, maintains a safe distance between the car and other vehicles that are driving ahead of it. This technology primarily uses cameras in conjunction with artificial intelligence algorithms to detect surrounding objects such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, and estimate their distances. Autosteer uses cameras to detect clearly marked lines on the road to keep the vehicle within its lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its Autopilot capabilities, Tesla has been offering what it calls â€œfull self-drivingâ€\\x9d features that include autopark and auto lane change. Since its first offering of the Autopilot system and other self-driving features, Tesla has consistently warned users that these technologies require active driver supervision and that these features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla is beefing up the AI technology that underpins Autopilot. The company announced on Aug. 19, 2021, that it is building a supercomputer using custom chips. The supercomputer will help train Teslaâ€™s AI system to recognize objects seen in video feeds collected by cameras in the companyâ€™s cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopilot does not equal autonomous\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvanced driver-assistance systems have been supported on a wide range of vehicles for many decades. The Society of Automobile Engineers divides the degree of a vehicleâ€™s automation into six levels, starting from Level 0, with no automated driving features, to Level 5, which represents full autonomous driving with no need for human intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin these six levels of autonomy, there is a clear and vivid divide between Level 2 and Level 3. In principle, at Levels 0, 1 and 2, the vehicle should be primarily controlled by a human driver, with some assistance from driver-assistance systems. At Levels 3, 4 and 5, the vehicleâ€™s AI components and related driver-assistance technologies are the primary controller of the vehicle. For example, Waymoâ€™s self-driving taxis, which operate in the Phoenix area, are Level 4, which means they operate without human drivers but only under certain weather and traffic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla Autopilot is considered a Level 2 system, and hence the primary controller of the vehicle should be a human driver. This provides a partial explanation for the incidents cited by the federal investigation. Though Tesla says it expects drivers to be alert at all times when using the Autopilot features, some drivers treat the Autopilot as having autonomous driving capability with little or no need for human monitoring or intervention. This discrepancy between Teslaâ€™s instructions and driver behavior seems to be a factor in the incidents under investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother possible factor is how Tesla assures that drivers are paying attention. Earlier versions of Teslaâ€™s Autopilot were ineffective in monitoring driver attention and engagement level when the system is on. The company instead relied on requiring drivers to periodically move the steering wheel, which can be done without watching the road. Tesla recently announced that it has begun using internal cameras to monitor driversâ€™ attention and alert drivers when they are inattentive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother equally important factor contributing to Teslaâ€™s vehicle crashes is the companyâ€™s choice of sensor technologies. Tesla has consistently avoided the use of lidar. In simple terms, lidar is like radar but with lasers instead of radio waves. Itâ€™s capable of precisely detecting objects and estimating their distances. Virtually all major companies working on autonomous vehicles, including Waymo, Cruise, Volvo, Mercedes, Ford and GM, are using lidar as an essential technology for enabling automated vehicles to perceive their environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy relying on cameras, Teslaâ€™s Autopilot is prone to potential failures caused by challenging lighting conditions, such as glare and darkness. In its announcement of the Tesla investigation, the NHTSA reported that most incidents occurred after dark where there were flashing emergency vehicle lights, flares or other lights. Lidar, in contrast, can operate under any lighting conditions and can â€œseeâ€\\x9d in the dark.\\r\\n'"

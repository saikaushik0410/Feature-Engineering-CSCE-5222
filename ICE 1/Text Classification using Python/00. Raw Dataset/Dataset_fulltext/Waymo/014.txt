Following a 2017 crash in Williston, Fla. involving a Tesla driver who was warned seven times to put his hands back on the wheel without his vehicle being brought to a safe stop by Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board encouraged NHTSA to “develop a method to verify that manufacturers [of such systems] incorporate safeguards that limit the use of automated vehicle control systems to those conditions for which they were designed.”

Despite a contentious history with the safety organization — Tesla CEO Musk reportedly hung up on then-NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt during a heated conversation about another 2018 probe into another crash involving one of his company’s cars — the automaker did add new features to curb hands-off driving. But NHTSA has yet to update federal policies to require all companies to take such safety measures in the future — something the board hopes could finally happen now.

“Today’s action by NHTSA is a positive step forward for safety,” said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy in a release. “As we navigate the emerging world of advanced driving assistance systems, it’s important that NHTSA has insight into what these vehicles can, and cannot, do.”

My guess is the 4D dojo supercomputer recognizes that the pedestrian dummy is not a human and therefore sees no reason to perform evasive maneuvers. pic.twitter.com/R1mQqbxIy9 — degen (@finance_degen) September 20, 2020

A Tesla recall could have an impact on the company’s progress towards more advanced autonomous driving tech, too.

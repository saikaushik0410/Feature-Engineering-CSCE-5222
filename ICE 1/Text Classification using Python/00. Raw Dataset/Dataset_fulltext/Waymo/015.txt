In a decision that was widely decried by all but the most fervent AV-supporters, the company recently announced its intentions to release the latest edition of its “Full Self Driving” technology to a select group of its drivers for beta testing on neighborhood roads throughout the U.S., defying industry norms like testing new tech on private tracks, or at least using trained drivers when cars must be tested in the public right of way. Much like vehicles running on Auto-Pilot, Teslas equipped with “Full Self Driving” mode are not autonomous; they just offer additional features like automatic parking, along with still-nascent technology that the company says will someday identify “stop signs and traffic lights and automatically slows your car to a stop on approach, with [drivers’] active supervision.” (Emphasis ours.)

Musk has cautioned his beta-testers to “please be paranoid” on the roads, but advocates say that polite request is far less than the participants in his experiment deserve — especially because virtually all of the pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users, and other drivers involved are completely unwitting.

“Tesla defenders tend to say, [programs like] ‘Autopilot may not be perfect, but drivers accept the risk as they drive,'” adds Zipper. “Well, that may be true, but the people outside the car didn’t.”

Running preproduction software is both work & fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid. Safety is always top priority at Tesla. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 9, 2021

If NHTSA’s investigation fails to rein in Musk’s recklessness, advocates worry it may be challenging to exert control over the rest of the fast-changing industry. Most proponents of autonomous vehicles not employed by Tesla say they’re happy to keep the real self-driving technology off neighborhood roads until it’s certified safe, but verbal commitments from the private sector don’t carry the force of a government mandate. The bipartisan infrastructure bill currently being debated in Congress largely ignored the autonomous vehicle revolution, besides making the industry eligible for new research and development grants.

Advocates are hopeful that NHTSA’s new investigation is a sign that they’re finally stepping up to the plate.

“I don’t know why we need Congress to get NHTSA to do its job,” added Zipper. “The NTSB has been basically jumping up and down screaming that we need to do something about this Tesla for years. Maybe now they will. … And maybe someday, they’ll expand their capacity to do more investigations like this.”
Federal Investigation into Tesla Autopilot Defects Could Pull 765k Cars From U.S.
If the investigation results in a recall, an estimated 765,000 cars could be pulled from U.S. roads — the majority of the vehicles ever produced by the company.
“Tesla defenders tend to say, [programs like] ‘Autopilot may not be perfect, but drivers accept the risk as they drive,'” adds Zipper.

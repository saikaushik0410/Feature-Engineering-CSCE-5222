Musk has now officially set the date for next Friday and he expects that about two weeks after that (around September 25), an updated version, Beta 10.1 is expected to be good enough for public rollout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo after being postponed several times and many months, it looks like all Tesla owners whose vehicles have the right hardware will be able to experience FSD. The software and the neural network behind it have been improved a lot recently and Tesla opted to eliminate the need for anything other than cameras with Version 9 of the system, what the manufacturer called 'Pure Vision.'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way Elon phrased it in his tweet, though, itâ€™s clear heâ€™s not 100 percent confident that Version 10.1 will, in fact, be good enough for public release. Not that long ago, he admitted that making cars that drive themselves is a far harder task than he anticipated and combined that with the ongoing NHTSA investigation into the Autopilot feature and you can understand why the manufacturer will treat this public rollout with maximum caution.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the deadline is respected, this still only means Tesla drivers from the US will gain access to FSD, but not those from Canada, Europe or China. Regarding Canada, though, it could probably be next after the US, and Musk expects that FSD will be made available in the country in a few monthsâ€™ time, while no date for Europe has thus far been set.\\r\\nAfter a few days ago Elon Musk announced that the public debut of Full Self-Driving Beta was just weeks away, now the Tesla CEO has tweeted the exact time and date when Version 10 Beta will be made available to beta testers.\\r\\nMusk has now officially set the date for next Friday and he expects that about two weeks after that (around September 25), an updated version, Beta 10.1 is expected to be good enough for public rollout.\\r\\nSo after being postponed several times and many months, it looks like all Tesla owners whose vehicles have the right hardware will be able to experience FSD.\\r\\nThe way Elon phrased it in his tweet, though, itâ€™s clear heâ€™s not 100 percent confident that Version 10.1 will, in fact, be good enough for public release.\\r\\nEven if the deadline is respected, this still only means Tesla drivers from the US will gain access to FSD, but not those from Canada, Europe or China.\""

       "'Amid Teslaâ€™s Autopilot Probe, Nearly Half the Public Thinks Autonomous Vehicles Are Less Safe Than Normal Cars\\r\\nMore than 50% of Americans have not heard much or anything about the crashes involving Tesla vehicles using â€œAutopilotâ€\\x9d or the federal governmentâ€™s investigation into the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n17% believe autonomous vehicles are as safe as cars driven by humans, up from 8% in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n37% of U.S. adults said they may ride in an autonomous vehicle in the future and 34% said they would not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inside of a Tesla vehicle is viewed as it sits parked in a new Tesla showroom and service center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on July 5, 2016, in New York City. The electric car company and its chief executive and founder, Elon Musk, have come under increasing scrutiny following a crash of one of its electric cars while using the Autopilot service. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the federal government investigates Tesla Inc. for crashes involving its vehicles using the â€œAutopilotâ€\\x9d feature, a new poll indicates much of the public has safety concerns about autonomous vehicles, though Americansâ€™ interest in the cars has risen slightly compared to a few years ago. Forty-seven percent of U.S. adults said in the new Morning Consult poll that they believe AVs are less safe than cars driven by humans, down slightly from the 50 percent who said the same in a March-April 2018 survey. That poll was conducted shortly after the first-known fatal pedestrian accident in the United States involving a self-driving vehicle, which was being tested by Uber Technologies Inc. in Arizona.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventeen percent of adults believe AVs are as safe as regular cars driven by humans, up from 8 percent who said the same in 2018, although the number of people who believe self-driving vehicles are safer than regular cars has dropped from 27 percent in 2018 to 22 percent in 2021. Despite the recent setbacks for autonomous vehicles, public interest in self-driving cars has increased slightly since 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latest survey, 23 percent of adults said they would ride in an AV, up from 19 percent who said the same in the 2018 survey. Another 37 percent said they may ride in an AV in the future, an increase from three years ago within the surveyâ€™s 2 percentage-point margin of error. The latest poll comes on the heels of an investigation launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last month into Tesla. NHTSA said it has identified 11 instances across nine different states where Tesla vehicles that had engaged either its â€œAutopilotâ€\\x9d or â€œTraffic Aware Cruise Controlâ€\\x9d modes crashed into vehicles driven by first responders on scene at an investigation. Shortly after the agency began scrutinizing the company, a Tesla Model 3 struck a parked police car and a Mercedes SUV in Orlando, Fla., with the driver telling officers she was using Autopilot at the time of the crash. While Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been bullish on his companyâ€™s efforts, describing them as â€œarguably the leaders in real-world AIâ€\\x9d during Teslaâ€™s first â€œAI Dayâ€\\x9d last month, he has also been more measured in some recent comments. In late August, he said in a tweet that Teslaâ€™s latest self-driving software update was â€œnot greatâ€\\x9d but noted that the companyâ€™s AI team was working â€œas fast as possibleâ€\\x9d to improve it. Teslaâ€™s critics, meanwhile, are keen to rein in the company. New National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy told Bloomberg that confusion over the capabilities of automated driving systems like Autopilot could impact public trust in the potential safety benefits of the technology. And Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) jointly called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla for its â€œpotentially deceptive and unfairâ€\\x9d advertising of Autopilot as being fully autonomous. While Teslaâ€™s AV crashes have received national attention from regulators and lawmakers, polling suggests that news of the NHTSAâ€™s investigation â€“ and the crashes themselves â€“ has failed to break through to the general public.\\r\\nMore than 50% of Americans have not heard much or anything about the crashes involving Tesla vehicles using â€œAutopilotâ€\\x9d or the federal governmentâ€™s investigation into the matter.\\r\\n17% believe autonomous vehicles are as safe as cars driven by humans, up from 8% in 2018.\\r\\n37% of U.S. adults said they may ride in an autonomous vehicle in the future and 34% said they would not.\\r\\nDespite the recent setbacks for autonomous vehicles, public interest in self-driving cars has increased slightly since 2018.\\r\\nand Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) jointly called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla for its â€œpotentially deceptive and unfairâ€\\x9d advertising of Autopilot as being fully autonomous.'"
